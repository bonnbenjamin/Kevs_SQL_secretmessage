# Kevs_SQL_secretmessage

As you already know, these lines of code i pasted from Stack O and just hope it works, most i could do was able to put our own filename into it.
I was lucky enough the code (kinda) works and pull out the info in there and I took a peak, then a guess.
All in all I still feel im very inadequate in this particular skill here.

None of the work below is mine.

i found 3 solutions and left the one that works for me #2 uncommented, you can check the rest too.
